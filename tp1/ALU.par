   "ALU" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s100e, package cp132, speed -5

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.320 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.27 2013-10-13".

Phase 4.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

...............
ERROR:Place:1018 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB /
   clock site pair. The clock component <b1_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y10>. The IO component <b1> is
   placed at site <IPAD36>.  This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. If this
   sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf
   file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of this override is
   highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be
   corrected in the design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is listed below. These
   examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to override this clock rule.

* Some of the Clock networks are NOT completely routed

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

104 signals are not completely routed. See the ALU.unroutes file for a list of all unrouted signals.

WARNING:Par:100 - Design is not completely routed. There are 104 signals that are not
   completely routed in this design. See the "ALU.unroutes" file for a list of
   all unrouted signals. Check for other warnings in your PAR report that might
   indicate why these nets are unroutable. These nets can also be evaluated
   in FPGA Editor by selecting "Unrouted Nets" in the List Window.
